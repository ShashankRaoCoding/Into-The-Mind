To understand the evolution of human society, one is thus compelled to learn about the ideas of the different stages of human society, why some ideas became obsolete while others grew, and the what ‘ideas’ are in the first place. \nBefore I begin this chapter, let me assert one fundamental truth: this book and its contents were written in hindsight. This is meant to be an objective view of history, covering the most salient points I have picked from my own readings. As such, it is by no means unbiased - in fact it is highly prone to survivor biases and my own willingness to engage with certain ideas. This is not a book trying to seek truth, nor draw conclusions, but is simply my attempt at both description and rationalization. \nAdditionally, I would like to acknowledge the overlap between ideas presented here and those argued in works by other, more capable authors. This book touches upon the subject of mematics, Darwinian natural selection, and the theory of knowledge itself, without necessarily taking them by name. As such, the ideas presented may concur with, contradict, or repeat existing theories. To the best of my abilities, I have pointed the reader in the direction of the source of the ideas that I have taken inspiration from, built upon, or used to further my own arguments, or quoted. This does not mean that my interpretation of such ideas is the only interpretation, and indeed I am sure some of my arguments within this book would go against the ideas of the authors who’s works I have built upon or modified. \nIn such cases, I request the reader to read through to the end. I believe it quite likely I have acknowledged such contradictions, attempted to explain them, or pointed in the direction of further reading that would enable the reader to accept and reject ideas based on their own judgement. \nLastly, I would highly encourage readers to explore ‘The Selfish Gene’ by Sir Richard Dawkins, as my own work is heavily inspired by it. I imagine Sir Dawkins would be rather disappointed in this work, however, as although much of it is similar to his own book, my work may appear to connect his own ideas of cultural selection to genetic selection - a direction I believe his book opposes rather strongly. I assure readers that, while my arguments do in fact connect to genetic natural selection and cultural selection, this is only incidental to a more elegant theory that is common to both. \nChapter 1: What are ideas? \nTo understand what ideas are, we must first look at an even more atomic and indeed simple yet pervasive object. Throughout history, knowingly or unknowingly, every being, human or otherwise, has used or drawn from this object their entire understanding of self. No ideology, scientific, real, illusory, or otherwise, exists that does not stem from this fundamental abstraction: the ‘model’. \nThe ‘model’ is, simply put, an image of a world. I say a world, because it does not necessitate that models created are models of reality. In fact, to the contrary, it can be argued that no model in the history of humanity has ever been a ‘true’ model - a model that reflects reality precisely. A model is the abstract representation of our understanding of a world. It is a system of using past information to deduce the rules that affect the objects within the system, in an effort to predict the outcomes of actions. \nIn other words, it is a theory. The more refined a model, the closer it is to reality, and thus the better its predictions. Models allow us to predict reality without comprehending it in its entirety. \nThose who have engaged with the theory of modern science to even a shallow extent will find nothing new in this concept. The Newtonian Theory of Gravity is a model for how gravity works. The Einstein Relativity theory is a Model for how time and space work. \nSome of the more discerning readers and thinkers might also find the following ideas intuitive, or even repetitive, but it is imperative that I state them nevertheless, as the foundation upon which rest of the narrative for human history is built: all ideas are theories, and exist within models. The ideas of religion, are as much a model as ‘science’ - both seek to explain the world using past events to deduce the rules that govern the world, in an effort to predict the consequences of actions. Science and more conventional religions are also united in that they use this information to then advise the interpreter on the course of action to lead to favourable outcomes, which is why both these types of models have became so prevalent throughout human history: they give order. \nChapter 2: Why a Society \nA society is a rather loose term, and deliberately so. Its vagueness stems from its vast jurisdiction of ideas. To understand what society is, we must first look at why humans decided to form these. \nAll life requires the use of models, albeit to varying extents. The model of the world in a dog’s mind is likely very different from ours’. For example, their world may lack certain colours that ours does have, and the limited cognitive abilities also means that their model is less refined. Recall from chapter 1 that a less refined model is less robust and has less predictive powers. This manifests itself in many non-human animals in the form of what some perceive as less cognitively enabled beings. \nMost animals would, unsurprisingly, move away from a falling object. This shows that they are aware that the unobstructed object will fall towards the ground, and that, if caught in its path, injuries may result. This information in the animal’s mind is deduced from past experiences, and within its model for the world, it likely deduced the existence of a rule identical to gravity. That is not to say it understands gravity in the true form, or even to the extent of many humans, but it is a model nonetheless with its own predictive capabilities. \nBefore I proceed, I would like to make clear that, although the arguments in the following paragraphs are laid out sequentially, implying cause and effect, the ideas presented most likely evolved parallel to each other, shaping each other bit by bit. However, thinking of it sequentially provides a more intuitive approach to understanding the evolution of the human society. \nHumans, through the evolutionary process, evolved the more sophisticated brain, enabling greater cognition and with it more sophisticated models. The more sophisticated a model, the more capable it is with its predictive powers. However, to the early human, there was perhaps little to be gained from such increased cognition on its own. Initially, perhaps it helped them realise patterns, such as edible, inedible, and toxic flora, but to such humans who can think with a model sophisticated enough to understand time, one aspect of their reality would have become very, terrifyingly clear: uncertainty. \nIf the first pillar of society and existence for humans is the desire to survive, then uncertainty would be the second such pillar to motivate humans to action. I am sure many readers will have ideas of their own regarding that rather blanket statement, but I do request that you hold those thoughts until chapter 6, as I use the word survival to mean a rather unconventional continued existence, but I digress. To the early humans, uncertainty reflected in a lack of a guarantee for the next meal, a lack of guarantee of survival the next moment, and so on. \nThis lack of certainty could to come extent be mitigated for humans (a comparatively physiologically weaker species who were primarily scavengers far from the top of the food chain) by collaborating with other humans. This was in an effort to compensate for lack of power with numbers. However, introducing other humans introduces its own form of uncertainty - indeed even in the modern world, one of the most unpredictable variables tends to be the human minds that inhabit it. \nTo address this evolved the third pillar of human society: communication. Although vastly differing in their sophistication and capabilities, both modern and ancient communication, as well as arguably all forms of communication of any kind between living beings, are in an effort to understand. To further expand this, let us understand why communication is so important to humans and life in general. \nThe formation of models, as previously established, requires rules. Rules, as explained, are deduced from information, and for all humans information comes in the form of interactions with the world through our 5 senses. Thus, interaction is the fundamental requirement for the formation of a model. For a model in a human’s mind that factors in other humans as a variable, we must therefore interact with other humans. \nTo some readers, this may signal that communication is a form of, or even a synonym of interaction, but it is not so, for we are still missing a key part of the bigger picture: feedback. \nRecall that models exist primarily as a means of predicting the consequences of actions. Thus, without experiencing consequences, a model cannot correct to align itself with reality better. This process of experiencing consequences and linking them to decisions arrived at with the model can be termed as ‘feedback’. A model that seeks to improve itself will change itself so that its chosen actions result in consequences as close to its predictions as it can get. \nIt is also interesting to note that in such a scenario, the model in one human’s mind is attempting to predict another human mind’s actions, which in itself are determined by a model. This implies that models are capable of not only interacting with, but forming predictions relating to each other. Such a conclusion in essence would be correct, although this is a very easily misinterpreted idea. For example, when you interact with your environment, even with conventionally non-living objects, you perform an action, a consequence results, and your senses provide information interpreted as feedback for your actions. This is your interaction with your non-living environment, constituting communication. And indeed this aligns with our definitions of reality and models, and also of interaction and communication. Every action is a form of communication, and exists for the sole purpose of providing a model with information. \nReturning to the question at hand, however, the idea that humans evolved communication is laughably lofty. It is perhaps, with our more mature understanding and definition of communication, apt to say that humans developed a more complex means of communication than the sounds and physical queues our animal brethren make use of: language. \nWhile it would be most interesting to fill the next few pages with musings of the abstractness of language as a model in itself, that would not lead us to the answer we are looking for in this chapter, and thus I leave that as an excercise to the reader and thinker. Instead, I shall concern myself with communication, and the advent of the fourth pillar of society: ideology. \nChapter 3: Language and Ideologies \nLanguage essentially allowed humans to peer into each other’s models deeper, and thus form more complex understandings of each other. It also enabled us to make information reception from our senses richer. While humans likely largely used their hearing as a means of detecting movement, it has become increasingly used as a form of communication, a medium for language, in recent history (roughly the last 12,000 years). This allowed us not only the ability to understand others, but to then influence others. \nRecall in the second chapter that models use feedback information to align themselves better with reality. This requires that a model make changes to itself, in order to produce different, more accurate predictions. Thus, if a model can predict another model, the former model will also be able to attempt to provide specific feedback to the latter model, in the hopes of changing it in a specific way. \nThis may seem manipulative or devious, and indeed this is the idea behind lies and half-truths. For the time that a person believes in a record of past events different to what actually transpired, their model is out of sync with reality, and thus their actions may not be what they would otherwise enact should they have had a more accurate model of reality, drawn from the right information feedback. \nHowever, it is also this same system of editing each other’s models that enables us to learn new things. This could be factual information, scientific theories, algebra, or religious ideas, or even the ideas of good table manners. All of these are the influence of the many models that we are surrounded by and take feedback from. \nHowever, this mutual editing of models leads to a rather interesting emergent effect: the formation of collective models. This is perhaps the most nuanced and complex pillar of society, and without which modern society would not exist in its current form. It is the glue that binds us, and finally provides the answer to the first pillar of uncertainty. It also is, perhaps, the most evolved pillar of the 4, and even individual strands of this pillar form entire factions and divide people to this day. \nThe term ‘ideology’ is vague, too, similar to ‘society’, but fret not dear reader, this time there is little to be gained from breaking down the term further, and thus I shall refrain from doing so. Instead, we have a much simpler way of dealing with this vagueness: defining ‘ideology’ in terms of the ‘model’. For our purposes, and I would argue most if not all human purposes too, an ideology is the term used for a model which exists in the minds of more than one individual. It is a ‘shared model’ so to speak. I draw heavy inspiration from the ideas of Dr Yuval Noah Harare in this section, for his ideas on ‘shared realities’ is essentially the same as far as I can understand it. However, while he explains it from the top down with real world examples, we have built up to the idea from the bottom up by defining the more fundamental idea of models. \nBut, getting back to the question I posed in the heading of chapter 2: Why form a Society? \nA society is formed to bring order to humans in an otherwise uncertain world. By holding a shared model of reality, humans are able to cooperate effectively by essentially decreasing how uncertain they are of their fellow humans’ actions by communicating with and understanding each other. This cooperation brings security, ensuring survival. \nAt the heart of every human endeavour is survival. Society is a means of reducing the uncertainty around it, and thus a society collapses when it fails to convince its followers of its ideology’s predictive capability, or the ideology’s predictions are refuted with feedback to its followers. \nThat is to say, that a society draws purpose from what it gives to its followers, and gains power from the conviction its followers hold in its ideology. Like clothes, societies may choose to mend their ideologies, or cast them off altogether in the face of more capable ideologies throughout time, while still holding onto the other pillars. This has been seen very significantly in the cold war of the very recent human history, where without changing language, or perceived social systems of power, countries switched from communist ideologies to capitalistic ones in Europe.  Elsewhere, it can be seen in people joining and leaving religions. \nThe pillars of society may also make another thing very clear to readers, and that is that a society has no borders. Of course, a society whose ideology dictates a border may very well claim to have one, but it is not necessary for a society to do this. Religions in the conventional form are ideologies without borders. They have followers who believe, have a shared model of reality, are able to communicate with each other (if not in language, then in rituals, or common meeting grounds and other practices), and still do not have set boundaries. In a sense, to the conventional border-states that each have their own models (which often dictate who should be considered as part of one group or another) and by extension ideologies, conventional religions are a mirror world. Thus, it becomes possible to generally ascribe to multiple models of reality, each dealing with specific uncertainties and sometimes even making contrary predictions, though seldom provably so. \nWhen such proof does come about, however, it has the potential to shake conviction in a society’s ideology, and thus for conventionally religious societies, who draw their purpose and power from their ideology’s predictive power to answer uncertainties, they are often unable to simply cast off their ideology entirely. This leads to situations such as religious reforms, which in itself is also mirrored in the political world of ideologies in the more traditional legal and legislative reforms. \nIn other words, fundamentally, all societies are the same: they stem from shared models. They differ only in the specifics: the boolean of the presence or absence of borders, and the proportion of import that each pillar holds to that society. \nChapter 4: Is Science a Religion? What about Atheism? \nThere have been many scholars far more competent and qualified than I who have argued both sides of this debate, but that has not stopped me from giving my very own two cents’ worth these last few chapters, so why begin now? \nScience holds a special spot in human history. It is a ‘Society’ of scientists unlike any predecessor, mainly because it is a society that demands its ideologies to be proven false. This is the only society where conviction in its predictive capabilities grow stronger each time the ideology is shown to incorrectly predict reality. But why is Science an exception? \nFundamentally, because it is part of a new generation of models. In the same way that ideologies were a generation of models that differentiated their impact by being ‘shared’ models, models such as science are ‘meta’ models, so to speak. They are the emergence of competing models, a collection of the ‘fittest’ models, the ones that predict reality the best. And each time one of these sub models are shown to be less fit than a new competing model, the sub model is switched for the new one. Science, on the whole, remains ever the same. \nSome may argue that Science is not the same, that it is evolving too, and to them there lies the task of answering the Ship of Theseus. Regardless of what the answer is, however, the fact remains that Science cannot be so simply explained in its approach to modelling reality as past ideologies, and I propose that this is because it is an emergence of models, unlike any previous ideologies. Perhaps, in the coming future of humanity, we shall see more such meta models appear. Perhaps not. Perhaps science shall remain the only one. \nBut I did use a rather interesting word that many readers would have picked up on: ‘fittest models’. Yes, that was a very obvious allusion to Darwinian natural selection, though I prefer to abstract the idea into a more generalised principle. Let us explore this further in a subsequent chapter, chapter 5. For now, instead, we focus on the latter question this chapter’s title posed: What about Atheism? \nAtheism, I would argue, is as much a religion as any other. I am sure that statement is sure to have ruffled more than a few feathers on more than one side of the religious polychotomy, but it simply the logical conclusion one must draw from the earlier definitions of the various pillars of society, the definition of ideology, and that of models. \nAtheism rejects conventional religious models, with adherents often choosing to adopt science as their means of understanding the world instead. In essence, this is the same as religious adherents: both seek to understand the world in a bid to predict the future, providing certainty. For many it is the uncertainty of afterlife, for some it is the logic behind praying, or for some the lack thereof. Fundamentally, by the definitions laid out so far, atheism is as much a religion as the conventional ones, and science is as much an ideology as communism, though I do note quite strongly the difference of a meta-ideology to the more standard ones we have come to be comfortable with in recent history. I, for one, cannot claim to comprehend to a lesser or greater extent, how impactful this distinction will be, but it is certainly a distinction to note nonetheless. \nHowever, this rather simple view of society does not answer some critical questions hidden in the details. For one, it fails to explain the complexity of modern societies. Sure, laws bring about order, but many of them are not so bothered with basic human needs such as survival, nor do they try to answer existential questions. To answer this, we must turn to the idea of Information Selection. \nChapter 5: Information Selection \nDear readers, I am sure it is not lost on you that I have deliberately omitted the use of ‘Natural Selection’ as the title. The importance is very much of concern to us, but we must start from Natural Selection to understand why. \nIn the previous chapter, I used the term fitness to describe a model. I arrived at the conclusion following the application of Natural Selection principles to models. I understand if you do not follow, or that seems illogical, but let me explain. And to do that, I shall require that you follow my train of thoughts as I have laid it out here, subject to your scrutiny. As to why I am doing this, that shall become obvious when we reach the end of this chapter. \nFirst, to see if my application of Natural Selection to models is even valid, we must define the rules that govern whether natural selection principles can be applied in a given system. Initially, to do this we can turn to the conventional understanding of natural selection: the emergent effect stemming from competition between different individual life forms for limited resources, resulting in the survival and propagation of those organisms with the traits allowing greatest chances of survival. \nHowever, this wording has a few flaws. If this were in fact the definition of the phenomenon of Natural Selection, many contradictions arise with reality. \nOften, it has been noted, that a mother tiger may eat a sick cub to replenish her strength. While that may not in itself be very surprising, it is far more interesting to note the lack of significant resistance from said cub. That goes against general understanding of natural selection: why would an organisms willingly accept its own end? We see such oddities even in human society: some of the most wildly ‘sucessful’ people in modern societies, particularly the heads to religions, may choose to be celibates - the antithesis to propagating one’s own genes. \nSome of you readers may be able to see where I am going with this, particularly readers of the Selfish Gene but Sir Richard Dawkins. I draw in part from his work in this section to build upon it a more generalised system of applying selection ideas, but I digress. \nThe answer to the seeming contradiction in the previous couple of paragraphs, to the generally understood concept of natural selection is thus: it is not the organisms that are being selected for, but their genes. \nWhen the sick cub, which already has limited chances of survival, is consumed by the parent, it enables the parent to live longer, perhaps enabling further births. Resources that would have otherwise gone to the sick cub can be redirected to its remaining siblings, thus increasing their chances of surviving. Crucial to note here, is that these siblings, and the parent, all draw from the same gene pool. In essence, a small number of instances of those genes ‘sacrificed’ themselves, so that there would be better chances of their clones surviving. If you see natural selection from the eyes of these genes, oddities such as celibates more than make sense in the fact that they increase the chance of the genes surviving. \nBut does this mean that natural selection is a system of selecting genes? Not quite, there is something to be said about the specific combinations of the genes, and the fact that new genes and traits arise as old ones become obsolete. Therein we are once again faced with the Ship of Theseus question, but that is not the most consequential part of this section. What is far more interesting, at least to me, is that we applied natural selection to something more fundamental than an organism: a gene. But what is a gene? The textbooks will helpfully let you know that they are a length of DNA that code for a specific protein; in essence they are information. \nThus, I propose the following rules for applying selection ideas: \n\nThere are limited resources \nThere are variants of comparable information \nSaid variants are competing for limited resources, such that the less competitive variants are filtered out with time \n\nNote the use of the word, ‘comparable’. Later in this section it will become obvious why I highlight that, but for now let us revel in our achievement: we have encapsulated the rules required for applying selection ideas to information in general, instead of just within natural selection’s biological context. I do acknowledge the shortcomings of the nebulous vocabulary, such as ‘comparable,’ without defining what comparable is, but I do not believe such a rigorous framework is necessary to appreciate the ideas presented further in this book. \nWith that said, let us see if our ideas for societies fit these criteria. \nTo show that societies are in fact subject to selection, I would like to show that ideologies are subject to selection. Do note, that hidden within that sentence is the assumption that if ideologies are subject to selection, so too will be their societies - an assumption without foundation. But we shall get to that in due time. For the moment, we must concern ourselves only with ideologies, and answer each part of the question thoroughly. \nLooking at our requirements of selection theory: \n\nThe limited resources could be attributed to the strength or conviction of belief. Ideologies of the modern world and indeed the past must have believers, who are limited in number, to continue existing \nThe variants of comparable information can attributed to the existence of models that seek to answer the same questions (thus have the same purposes) but do so through varying means and lead to varying predictions (comparable, yet they are variants and not the same) \nVariants of ideologies may often require an adherent to choose between them, as is the case with most popular (conventional) religions of the 21st century as of writing this book. Thus, they are competing with each other for the limited resource: space. More precisely, mental space within which the belief in these ideological models exist, or in other words, believers \n\nNow, some readers may be quick to point out the fact that ideologies, as per my definitions, need not always compete. Since I said religion and politics are both societies with differing ideologies, this makes them comparable, and yet both a communist christian and a capitalist christian can simultaneously exist, without the conventional religion competing with the political ideology for their adherent’s belief, or as I termed it, ‘mental’ space. And such readers would be quite right: in such cases, the ideologies do not compete, and instead coexist. This can be seen in nature too. Since competition is a key requirement for selection ideas, as stated in point three of our initial rules, we do not apply selection theories in such instances. \nI hope I have convinced you of the soundness in logic with my train of thoughts thus far. Take the time out to convince yourself about all of the above, before you proceed. \nConvinced? Fantastic. Now to the summit of this logical mountain we have been scaling! \nSince we have established that certain models may be in competition with each other, and the models at large fulfil the other 2 criteria we had laid out in the earlier sections of this chapter, we are now free to apply to them selection ideas. Since we are selecting based on variants of ‘Information,’ I shall henceforth refer to this as information selection, a broader application of the ideas of natural selection. \nI am sure to many readers the implications have already become obvious, most apparently so in the competition of conventional religions. \nHistory shows that long ago, human society based around religions had a far smaller scope. Pagan religions of the past focussed on crowning inanimate objects as sacred dwellings of or as gods/spirits. Shifting to more recent modern history, the questions religion answered centred around morality, and more abstract concepts. Religions that, essentially, did this better than others, lead to more stable societies due to greater predictability. Since these ideologies were in competition with each other, the fitter religion survived. This would the the religion more capable of answering its questions: what comes after life, for instance. \nBut even if ideologies are in competition with each other that does not necessitate that societies are in competition with each other, too. The purpose of this entire train of thoughts, then, which was to attempt to answer the aspects of modern societies I mentioned in the ultimate section of chapter 4 (I would highly encourage you to reread the section to be reminded of the question asked) seems misdirected. That is because there is still another step we must take. \nTo attribute the aforementioned complexities of society as a product of the evolution of ideologies through information selection, I am now tasked with demonstrating that societies are also in competition with each other, and are linked to their ideological pillars. This flies in the face of my earlier statements, comparing ideologies to clothes, going so far as to say that a society may cast off its ideology in favour of a more competent one. Or does it? \nTo answer this, let us turn to the Roman Empire, and its many preceding forms. Initially started as a monarchy, Rome went through a series of transformations, into an oligarchy, into a democratically elected dictatorship, and then later once again to a monarchy as the empire grew and shrank. Through its lifespan, its chief ideologies changed drastically, and Roman ‘society’ changed from being a group of pagans to Christians later in history. However, throughout this rather tumultuous period survived another idea, one that remained in the background like the invisible puppet master of a show: the identity of being a Roman. \nIndeed, nationalities and all other ideas of the nature that we called our identity, if they are shared ideas, are ideologies. While certain ideologies such as the conventionally religious ideas may have competed with each other, the Roman identity was competing with an entirely different rival of its own: the Gauls and the Etruscans, later the Greeks and the Phoenicians. \nHere, we return once more to more conventional selection, in the context of our understanding of information selection. Here, the information variants are the various cultures that form parts of each society. The resources they are limited by is the space, food, currency, and many more. They are all, also, generally in competition with each other. \nTo summarise, I am trying to show that these societies, particularly the judiciary ones, are part of neither political nor conventionally religious ideologies. They form their own kind, a cultural society. \nThis is not to say that there cannot be overlaps between these. Many religions demand certain laws, and some legislation may outlaw certain religious practices or groups, putting them into competition as seen with the crusades. However, bringing in the extra variables in such a context does not lead to the answer we were looking for at the ultimate section of chapter 4, so I shall continue using the Roman example and highlight the most salient of points that lead most directly to our answer. \nTo recap, the judiciary and laws are part of a cultural society. These compete with other comparable societies, mainly on the enforcement of laws. Thus, the resource being competed for, in another form of mental space, is enforcement. People who believe in laws and enforce them make the laws a force in the real world. Conversely, without anyone to enforce them, the law and its society would not exist. Thus, once again, adherents are a resource being competed for. A Greek would follow different laws to a Roman, perhaps worship different gods, and have different traditions. \nWe are almost at our answer, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: what is the purpose of laws? \nWhile many would argue morality, fundamental logic or even sanctity, approaching this question in the context of the hitherto established pillars of society, I would argue that they answer the very second pillar: uncertainty. \nWhen we communicate with reality (recall, communication as a form of interaction with feedback), we trust our environment to act predictably - or in other words, that the deduced rules will not change over time. This implicit assumption has plagued all ideas of models from the first chapter. It is just that, an assumption. However, being the most fundamental assumption, and also the only assumption made thus far save for the dichotomy of reality and the non-real, I shall instead refer to it with the much more elegant word: ‘postulate’. \nThus, I postulate, rather unsurprisingly, that rules endure regardless of situation. Anything that does not fit that criteria is not a rule. \nGoing back to our communication with the environment, we trust it implicitly because it does fulfil our postulate’s criteria: the laws of physics do not change, as far as we can tell or need to tell in daily life, and so we believe it and form our models around it. But what about other humans? \nEssentially, any society must attempt to enforce its synthetic laws with the same omnipotence and omnipresence as the natural laws in order to maintain its adherents, as this allows the adherents to be part of a more predictable, and thus less uncertain society. If another society appears more predictable, it will naturally outcompete a less predictable society, manifest through its stability. \nConventional religions are no exception to this, either, largely appealing to God or the natural forces which are attributed the same properties and powers (omnipotence and omnipresence should be familiar?). The societies able to better remain stable, outcompete others, may do so by enacting laws that do not necessarily involve answering more nuanced questions of modern societies - the need to answer this question arises from the competition with other societies that have their own variants of laws. \nThus, the survival of a society is directly linked not only to its ability to answer uncertainty in its absence, but to outcompete rival societies, leading to more complex systems than would evolve otherwise. \n \n\t \n\t\t.page-title { \n\t\t\tfont-size: 1.70rem; \n\t\t}\n\t \n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"index","links":[],"tags":[],"content":" \n\t \n\t\twindow.location.href = `shashankraocoding.github.io/Into-T.html` \n\t \n \n \n\t \n\t\t.page-title { \n\t\t\tfont-size: 1.70rem; \n\t\t}\n\t \n"}}
